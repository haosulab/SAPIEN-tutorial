    "The **articulation** is a set of **links** (each of which behaves like a rigid body) connected together with special **joints**. For instance, a drawer can be connected to a table by a **prismatic** joint (slider), and a door can be connected to a frame by a **revolute** joint (hinge). A robot is also an instance of an articulation. Articulations are usually loaded from [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML) XML, which you can find example in the comprehensive tutorial linked at the top. This tutorial showcases how to create an articulation programmatically by SAPIEN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Articulations can be controlled by applying `torques` on their joints. To drive an articulation to a desired state, users can apply a [controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) to compute corrective torques according to the difference between the actual and the desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn the following:\n",
    "- Create Articulation\n",
    "- Control the articulation with builtin controllers\n",
    "- Get kinematic quantities of the articulation\n",
    "\n",

They implies the extent to which the drive attempts to achieve the target position and velocity respectively. There do not exist a general rule to set those values and you usually should tune them case by case. If you are familiar with control theory, they correspond to P and D terms in [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). The initial target position and velocity of a joint are zero by default. Since our toy car is designed to be a front-wheel drive car, we set both the stiffness and damping as zero for the back gear."
